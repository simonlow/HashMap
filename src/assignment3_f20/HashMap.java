/* Behavior: A HashMap will provide Map operations, and also these:

  minKey: 
    in: none
    return: string, the key from the hash table that is smallest
    effect: no hash table state change
      if hash table size if 0, return null

  maxKey: 
    in: none
    return: string, the key from the hash table that is largest
    effect: no hash table state change
      if hash table size if 0, return null

  getKeys 
    in: nothing
    return: an array of strings, containing just the keys from the hash table cells
    effect: the array of strings is produced in unspecified, which means it is ok 
      to just go through the table subscript 0 up and pull keys from the cells

  hash
    in: the key (a String), and table size (an int)
    return: integer hash value for the given key and table size
    effect: no change to hash table state
  
  lambda
    in: nothing
    returns: the lambda value for the table (a double)
    effect: no change in the state of the hash table

  extend
    in: nothing
    returns: a new lambda value, after the table array has been extended
    effect: the array that is the hash table is doubled in size, and the elements 
      in the old table are rehashed (using the new array size) and stored 
      in the new table array
      number of elements stored is unchanged, array is doubled in size 
      (and so lambda gets cut in half)
  
  // leave this in... for grader
  // also specific to tree structure
